### General info
This application is going to allow user to create his weekly diet (drag recipes to callendar) and generate shopping list for whole week.

### Technologies
* Java 11
* Spring 2.2.2
* Maven 4.0.0
* Junit 5
* JavaFX 11.0.2
* FasterXML for Jackson conversion

### Status
* I started from creating basic view in JavaFX, just to learn it a little bit and see how it works.
* Currently I'm working on logic of the app, and tests. When I finish it, I'll finish also visual side of this app.
* I was thinking about adding Spring to this project, to get dependency injection, but DietPlanner is a small project and I'm not sure if adding such a big framework would be a good idea.
